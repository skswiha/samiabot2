Good morning, fatigue
I remember you fondly
We bathed in the grease on the McDonald's floor
And we wanted to jump off the pier at the seaport
Pondering whether we'd been here before
Welcome to Phoenix, they scream through the overhead
You're just lucky you're tired and not dead
'Cause it's just milk/It's just milk on the floor
And it's just me and it's not you anymore
Goodnight to my namesake/At will of an alien lung/Like a cedar tree bent 45 degrees
You are too grand I am shouting at no one
But sweet tender baby, the damage is done
Oh welcome to Phoenix/Nobody's been killed/So don't cry, my dear, over something you spilled
If it's just milk/It's just milk on the floor
And it's just me and it's not you anymore
They pull the plug and her spirit ascends and she's singing to me from on high
I'm in the bathroom seeing how far my two fingers can fit around my thigh
It's just milk/It's just milk on the floor/And it's just me and it's not you anymore
And it's just milk/It's just milk on the floor/And it's just me and it's not you anymore
Oh but kids you know what really wrecked it/Was his grand and histrionic exit
And I sat on that bed so perplexed/Strung out and fuming and vexed
Whisper louder what you want from me/Because I can't fucking hear you
You keep crying the way Jesus do/Maybe this isn't about you
Maybe this isn't about you
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
I have anecdotes to offer
They won't do much for this gentleman/'Cause his every thought's a sacrament/And his every word's been said
And I find this awfully boring/But I wouldn't ever say
Because God made boys all-knowing/And I wish God made me gay
And I wish God made me gay
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Couldn't hear what he said/Probably something prolific just like my ex-boyfriend
And he's got my ring in his bed
He turned me sideways and said/I don't wanna have sex/And I couldn't get a word in
I should've paid him
I'm just a vessel still/I guess need to be filled
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important anymore
Someone tell the boys they're not important
God boy gets up and he talks to his friends in the mirror/And he sees my mouth moving where his should be/Telling him he is too big for his body/That he's got the antidote America needs
And so I'm talking about drugs and their adverse effects/Like people do when they've lost a friend
But I think it was me and not the drugs in the end/'Cause God knows I have lost myself a veritable few of them
Don't let me give you my light it will blind you
I'll love you and leave you there searching to find you
Ain't that what they say at the meetings for those in my wake
Well I thought I was Eve but I guess I'm the snake
My sister is dead and it's due to my negligence/I buried her good on a New England beach
And I'll love her forever but how could she know/When I look in her grave and her cold fingers reach up and
Rachel, I'm sorry for calling you by the wrong name
It was just a suggestion but now/It's a small fundamentalist cult-style religion/From which you're relieved when you take things away from me
Josh, do you like my song?
Yeah, I knew you'd hate it all along
One of these nights you'll be wasted and vain/And you'll broaden your thought life/To Google your name/And you'll see that I wrote you/In spite of my shame
Josh, Josh/Don't say anything
Oh, wow, you are terrifying
Mouth in your ear I can't breathe
Crippling resentment towards your beliefs
Yours is the vice with which I punish me
Humor me, I need a little relief
Josh, Josh
You're done with your tea/You put it on the floor
You're making fun of me/I hear you through the door
Well if I wanted your opinion/I would have written you a song/But this one's for me, Josh
This one's for me Josh
Do you like me?/ /Never mind don't tell me
So many hours extracting your prose/From the balladry hairball that's lodged in my throat
If you open your mouth I am gonna explode
Josh, Josh/I know you don't
I do remember learning/It came and went real fast
But I'm wasted now on confidence
I'm busy, I'm hesitant to spend my precious time in class
I run a hamster wheel called Gamut/Wonder what my old friends think
They're swimming in the koi pond at the mall and yelling through the glass/"You are an opportunist dick"
I'm alive and I'm on fire
I'll have a cider
I will speak for my generation/Famous by association
I'm 21, I'm 21
I weigh a hundred and fucking something pounds/That makes me almost good
It is nice to be a hero/But it's better to be anything that anyone could want in a woman
My Sittoo's is watching me and laughing
Slumly, you're a grown-up now
You don't have to be an ingenue/And there is nothing wrong with you/As long as you make your family proud
You're alive and you're on fire
Why are you so tired
You're 21, you're 21/Can you believe it huh, you're 21
Salt of the earth, vinegar, piss
Pillar to post insisting this
Man, I can be here and not of it
I'm 21
It's a happy ending, darling/And you will not see me cry
I just wish that I could watch you light your cigarette one more damn time
Right now I'm a dead fish/No one sees me writhing
As I'm getting thinner and more worthy of your sex
Life is such a tease, sir
You and I agree, but you more so than me
I have always been a wreck
Oh, how easily you let me go
How I matched you in the moment I don't know
Django, Django, don't go
Shake the hand of every sir
I will watch you as you climb/And I'll dream of pouring pork fat on your ladder while I sleep tonight
You are just a silk ghost/With all good intentions/Reading off your passbook like its greek mythology
My skin feels like your skin I can't even touch it
Do you have an existential explanation now, for me?
Oh, how easily you let me go
How I matched you in the moment I don't know
Django, Django, don't go
Now you want to have a/Heavy conversation/But not if that deters me
You know I'm so happy/You say you're so lonely
Lonely
Lonely
Oh, how easily you let me go
How I matched you in the moment I don't know
Django, Django, don't go
I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my/I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my/I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my/I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m gonna keep saying that
I’m gonna keep saying/I’m gonna keep saying that
Dylan, Phil and Brian, Len and them/They used to line up in the gym/And touch my boobs each day at noon
I still feel your sweaty hands on them
So I’m pulling on my dress/But I’ll forget about it soon
I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my/I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my past
I’m not ashamed of my/I’m not ashamed of my past
It’s just a party trick
It’s just a party trick
It’s just a party trick
And if you’re playing to win/Well, if you’re playing to/Then you’re playing to win
Dylan, Phil and Brian, Len and them
I tried to tell them in the gym/That I was monstrous/And still from the jury they attest/Into the well beneath my chest
You are a monster, yes
Dylan, Phil and Brian, still, and Len
They brandish me like one of them
Come over after class
If this is how you make a lasting friend/I don’t much mind the imminent
I’ll be ashamed of my past
Total exhaustion in Paris
In our nook, we were in charge
Didn’t our future seem careless
Fleeting, beguiling mirage
I remember you wasting your time on me/Like I deserved your touch, babe
Back when our love was forever/Hemingway, those were the days
You were just one of those statues/I wished I could be at the Louvre
We were a renaissance novel/Carefully written by you
But I cannot play the princess/In your breathtaking charade/But oh how I tried to in Paris
Lover remember me that way
I’m sorry I dragged you to Starbucks/I thought you were being too proud
You just wanted a perfect story/I know as I’m reading it now
Our ghosts sit alone at the café/Each 6 o’clock in Montmartre/I hid my heart in our nook there
In Paris I’m still in your arms
Well, here we are back in the village/American just like before
Manhattan’s too small for the both of us/And I can’t take it anymore
I’m trying to be a big fish babe/There isn’t much room in your pond
But don’t write the end of our novel
I won’t write the end of our—
I synthesize my legs and eyes, my better side/I made you just me, dignified
Now I get to see you voguin' like I don't know how
Could you side with me, confide in me and reside in me?
Make it big and sign for me
Get me into trouble, check me as I mumble/Catch me as I stumble down
I know you will, honeybun
Keep it together for both of us
Maybe I can move like you/I know I already do
You're fillin' me with jealousy, it's killin' me
I give myself up willingly/Just so you can take me back to where you hang around
If I harden up, if I sharpen up, if I'm smart enough/Then I'll know it in my heart enough/To catch up with my double, check me as I mumble
Catch me as I stumble down
I know you will, honeybun
Keep it together for both of us
Maybe I can move like you/I know I already do
Honeybun
Both of us
Honeybun, ah
So when my banshee has a fit/Dance me back into the script
I know you will, honeybun
Keep it together for both of us
Maybe I can move like you/I know I already do
I know you will, honeybun
Keep it together for both of us
Maybe I can move like you/I know I already do
We're in a tin box, I've got a toothpick
And I have been poking the air
Somebody gave you a knife for your birthday
I think I know who, but it's not my affair
So I danced down the street like I'm Miss Angelina
My legs are so grounded and strong
And I'm not afraid that if I am the skipper
I'll steer my flesh into the bog
But is there something in the movies that's better than my love?
Is there something in the movies that's better than my love?
I carried around a stuffed pig in my arms
And I did it until I was five
I got it from someone who died of attention
And lived an extraordinary life
But I gave it to you on the day that we met
'Cause I already trusted you best
And everyone dies but they shouldn't die young
Anyway, you're invited to set
And is there something in the movies that's better than my love?
Is there something in the movies that's better than my love?
I left you in life/'Cause you don't need my pen to embellish your noteworthy parts
I only write songs about things that I'm scared of
So here now deathless in art
You've got this and the movies, and also my love/You can have it all, baby
I'm giving it up
On the bowery singin’ "Country Roads"
I was outta town when Dymphnas closed
Got prettier in Denver
Phasing out of this old fairy tale
Apple cider vinegar and kale
I'm fit and full as ever
If you want, I can take it off
And show you what my mama gave me
Only getting hotter as I sweat
I have never really been upset/Just hollow and amazing
All I want is to be like my dad
All I want's to give you what I have
I'm generous and vacant
If you want, I can take it off
And show you what my mama gave me
It's so hot/In this restaurant/I might just get fully naked
If you want, I can take it off/Show you what my mama gave me
The cleaning thing, the tidal creek
The murderous bird, her bleeding beak
The cleaning thing, the tidal creek
It's so hot in this restaurant
The murderous bird, her bleeding beak
I might just get fully naked
I got bug bites on my legs
I got two friends who look alive
I got coffee in the morning
And my mama in the night
And I got bad news but I didn't fight
I got bad news but I didn’t fight
I got a big wheel in Montana and he told me yesterday/That a year ago he looked me in the eyes and lied to me
Got an old friend in Japan
And she's been mad at me before/It's just that she and I have got nothing in common anymore
He feels bad for doing what he did that night
She bought new shoes in tokyo
I got bad news but I didn’t fight
I got bad news but I didn't fight
I got a lover in my bedroom or the smell of him at least/If he's somewhere getting smarter on a free man's odyssey
God I'm really gonna blow with all this empathetic shit
I understand the thing you did and every reason you did it
But I'm so mad dude and I wanna cry
I got bad news but I didn't fight
I got bug bites on my legs
Got a big wheel in montana
Got an old friend in Japan
Got a lover in my bedroom
And I got bad news but I didn't fight
I got bad news but I didn’t fight
I'll hold you from your small
How about that? How about that?
You made me medium tall
I'll make you feel good again
You made your car a vacuum
You pulled over too
So when you let me out/I owed my life to you
I wanna get you sedated/Like when it all began
I wanna play you records I like
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna let it all go
I swear I swear I do
Show me where you are stellate/I'll stick the needle through
You know it/But I can say it for you
You know it/But I can say it for you
And when the heat showed up
You couldn't open the door
I locked myself in and laid down on the kitchen floor
I put one of your vellum between my face and yours/So through the vellum you'd discern my face from yours
You know it/But I can say it for you
You know it
But I can say it for you
I wanna wake you up/Show you the boat I bought
I wanna go sailing with you to someplace we are not
You buy me a big bucket/I scream into that/And when it overflows/You want your money back
You know it/But I can say it for you
There is a place between your shoulder and chest/Which I would rather not leave
And when you let the drippings of the thing/Fall around me I am just/Awake and afraid, and screaming your name
Fuck, if your one sliced hand is not the keeper of the back of my neck
I came alive this morning, with the pit in my stomach because I/Rolled to the other side, if I missed you in the night I guess I'm/Going to Minnesota, huh?
I guess I'm going to Minnesota, huh?
Keeping your mouth real dry/So that my words will not dissolve on your tongue, but/I don't need to talk by some disgusting accident of communion
Fuck my feet, I'm trying to cross the stream but they keep/Going to Minnesota, huh?
I guess I'm going to Minnesota, huh?
I'm sneaking up without my manners
Scripture sink my teeth into the book/Where you keep your secrets about me
Kissing to trick you into/Easing your grip, so I can steal that shit and take it/Home from Minnesota with me
I guess I'm going to Minnesota, huh?
He said, "Bug, I think I love you bug"/I said, "Yeah, I think you love me too"
Even though you made me cry tonight/Nothing poisonous and nothing new
So I hurled myself into the pool/And I danced for all the party guests
I do only ever as I want/And especially when it's a test
Why you shakin'?
Why you shakin'?
You said, "It don't matter how you sing"
When you sing, we'll know the reason why
And your body's the housing thing/For the song that I'm confounded by
Why am I shakin'?
Why am I shakin'?
I wanna be your poetry
I'm sick and tired of bluffin'
You said when you get over me/You'll finally get it published/I think they're gonna love it
Drinking Mezcal like we're at the bar/Chase it with what I was gonna say
I know why I'm going where you are/And why I will find you on the way
There's a restaurant in the East Village/Where all the waiters are celebrities
My first love waited hours in the back/Making brazen advances toward Waverly
There's lore of a movie star leaving his number/For her on an old receipt/All I know is that she didn't call him
What a mystery, Waverly
Hey, I live/Across the street and/Wanted to know if you'd be my friend
Won't call again
I'm a patron dressed up like a person
I'm a creature instead of me
Dark at night and sunlight in the morning
Decide that I'll try aging gracefully
Here are all of my friends and my parents/This is my birthday party
You can push all the tables together/But you can't pull one over on Waverly
Hey, I live/Across the street and/Wanted to know if you'd be my friend/Won't call again
I said lovin' you is bigger than my head/And then you dove in
And then I said, "I'm afraid that I need men"/You said, "Need me then"
If you are really scared with your mouth up in the air/Then try to breathe under the water through this tube
How long do you think we can sit here/Before we have to move?
We don't talk much in the morning/Or beginning when you've just arrived
I find that I've forgotten why I did it/And I know your middle name/But I might know you if I didn't
In the moments when you're kissing/Like a baby in the kitchen, how long
How long, how long/Do I have left with my dog 'til I start forgetting shit
How long, how long/'Til we're rich and then we're not, and then we're rich
How much longer 'til I'm taller?
How much longer 'til it's midnight
How much longer 'til the mornin', are my legs gonna last?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
Take down, take heed/Fifth inning, cold feet
Call me names up there
Tugging at my cheeks/Higher, wider mouth slithering
On this high rise, watch the sea of dots go dun-dun-dun/Can't believe I'm touching pieces of when you were young
Good girl, sharp teeth/Your mouth, my feet
You can limbo, bitch/Dance before you quit
You can limbo, bitch
Dance before you quit
Put my panties on/Dance like you're the whore
Fold the flower out/Mine is yours
Happy birthday, angel
Take it with your bleeding hand
Think I like your mama too much not to say Amen
Good lord, we'll see
You can, have me
You can limbo, bitch/Dance before you quit
You can limbo, bitch
Dance before you quit
Good fox, they bite/You won't, you might
You can limbo, bitch/Dance before you quit
You can limbo, bitch
Dance before you quit
Keeping you awake, keeping you awake on purpose
Hey, did I make a mistake and do my mistakes worsen
I would give it up to every man I love
I take what I can get/And every woman too, I would too, that's my only secret left
I would entertain your feet or your hands for a triptych/Sell me at the Strand on the stands for a fat brick
I get what I want, and your girlfriend too/Make a predator of me
I'll be good to you
So before I turn it off, lit a light at my bedstand
Ask me what I thought of the life that I led and/I'll take off your pants, say goodnight to the ears there/Put you where I sing in the light in the damp air/And I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you
I'm the moving mouth, moving mouth with my eyes closed
Breathing an excuse, breathing loose through my new nose
I will buy a round on your dime like I used to
Feeding you my cake, you my cake, eating it too
I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you
After I cut up my thigh climbing over that fence with you/Brave and unnatural, already shrouded in reds and blues
I was so scared I had tetanus, I checked on it every night
Purple and yellow, the pregnable skin was so coarse and tight/And now I hope it does not heal
Now I hope it does not heal
You hope I'm blind, but I give you big what and say it again/Whipping your head, tryna hide behind hair that has not grown yet
I will stand in for an older me if you say, "I trust you"
Give me your hand, gonna bite off however much I can chew/And I hope you do not heal
I hope you do not heal
Turn down, evening comes/All smooth and licked up
I’m tough, I'm tough/But I hope I do not heal
I hope I do not heal
I hope I do not heal
I hope I do not heal
Your mom keeps threatening suicide on holidays
Your sister's in LA making dinner with fresh produce
And whether it’s a fallacy/You sing of love persistently/Sometimes when you sing to me
I still believe I know you
How am I supposed to wanna hear it anymore?
I'm trying to make you laugh/Sweating like an acrobat
Sometimes I speak on your behalf
I'm nervous on a full moon/When they can see it in your eyes/That you’re about to hit the sky
I'm hanging on the line that ties me to your pink balloon/How am I supposed to wanna hold it anymore?
I know еxactly when it turned into an accident/In thе bathroom, it was in the stars or wine or it was late
But I must've let you down/'Cause somewhere between then and now/I broke a promise that I didn't even know I made
How are you supposed to wanna love me anymore?
How are you supposed to wanna love me anymore?
Screaming, "Porn kills love"/Outside your window with the Adventists
I know it's wrong/Can't remember how I got like this
You said when I come on the radio/It makes you wanna die
Well, if I shut up/Can I come inside?
I don't wanna talk
I don’t really wanna work it out/We're too far gone/I just wanna see your house
You're looking at me like I'm the stranger here/I'm as strange as I'm standing in your mirror
I'll remember it June, 7PM/Getting pasta, watch your screensaver
Sea lions swim
Wear my hat that you hate/To the party and laugh at the movie postеrs/We'll never bе like those lucky poseurs
Why's your phone going to voicemail?
Your friends were so scary/I wish you were more like them
It was just like a movie/You carried me up into to your room/Raggedy Ann legs
I said, "Can I just sleep on the air bed?"
No, no, no/No, no, no
Drove me from the bar/Straight to the ER/While I bled on your car
The doctor was mean/But you called him a dumbass/And waited there all night
And then you said "Sorry"/And, "It wasn't mine, right?"
No, no, no/No, no, no/No, no, no
I shouldn't have picked up
Your logic was giant/Rendered me on my way and quiet
And I loved coming over/'Cause it felt like dying
And after you finished/You asked if I was crying
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
Called on a Sunday/Shakin' like crazy
Said, "I got a shrink/And she said the same thing/That everyone else did"
And then it was silent/You said, "Alright, am I being indicted?"
No, no, no/No, no, no/No, no, no
We played the Greek Theatre/You would've loved it
Noah said, "Can I ask about something?"/So I tried to tell him/Mostly from your side
And then I stopped breathing/So we did an exercise/Four in, six out
"Samia why would it matter what happened after you said-"/No, no, no
No, no, no/No, no, no
Got a good feeling about this weekend/Do you wanna go to Baby's?
It’s been a long week and I don't want to think/And Porches is playing
I've got my girls and a hopeful heart
We’re singing along, "Can you do no harm?"
Whatever you want it's at the bar
Nobody's gonna tell you who you are
It's all honey, honey/It's all honey
It's all honey, honey/It's all honey
I wanna go to the beach and die on the beach
I wanna be a mermaid
Not scared of sharks, not scared to be naked
I'm not scared of another day
From under here all you can hear is the/Distant boom of the hell’s angels
From under here all you can fear is being/Saved and being wakeful
It’s all honey, honey/It's all honey
It’s all honey, honey
It's all honey
I'm gonna wear a little black dress in the/Middle of the street, take my picture
And if you give me a beer, I'll forget to watch/What I eat and I don’t care
All you can do from this hotel room is fantasize
All you can do when he needs you is close your eyes
It's all honey, honey
It's all honey/It's all honey, honey
It's all honey
It's all honey, honey/It's all honey
It's all honey, honey
It's all honey
It's all honey, honey/It's all honey
Getting all lit up about the outdoor malls
Baby, let me show you the synthetic pond
Couldn't we believe it was the hand of God/Making water boogie to a Kesha song
You are so disarming with your honest smile/Tepidly confessing that you swallowed a fly
I just saw my whole life flash before your eyes
And I don't wanna charm anyone this time
Kissin' you would be kissin' on the USA/I'd be so afraid of what your daddy'd say
I could fetishize you for the whole damn day/Flying while I'm lying that I hate LA
What if we could shut up for an hour or two/Quiet, memorizing what the people do/Wouldn't have to try and find myself in you
I don't wanna charm you/I don't wanna make you mine
Half life of my mystifying isn't long enough for trying
I don't wanna charm anyone this time/I don't wanna make anybody mine/Mostly it's just I don't wanna end up crying
I don't wanna charm you
Everything with David is totally fine/Don't freak out, it's gonna be alright
You didn't say anything weird, I promise/But maybe you didn't need tequila for this
Trying to drown in a fountain of youth
How does anybody know when they're telling the truth?
I don't even remember why I'm saying sorry/But let's connect at the afterparty
To me, it was a good time
To me, it was a good time
Never enough if you're always too much
A couple bald men fighting over a brush
So you were bullied in high school and you're looking for payback/Like finding a needle in a stack of needles
Come on, baby, tеll it again/Every single thing that has already been said
And how much bеtter can anything get/Than sitting on your porch remembering it?
To me, it was a good time/To me, it was a good time
To me, it was a good time/To me, it was a good time
Jesus, let me take the wheel
Aren't you getting tired of all these people?
These fifteen minutes have become eternal/Publishing postmortem journals
Your makeup's running, American Honey/Dancing to Pour Some Sugar on Me
There might not be a second coming/That doesn't mean it was all for nothing
To me, it was a good time
To me, it was a good time
To me, it was a good time/To me, it was
To me, it was/To me, it was
To me, it was
To me, it was
Trying not to cry while the choir sings Bleak Mid Winter/'Cause they believe in something
Standing with your dad, posing for the photo/I'm so surprised they love me
You're my favorite friend, maybe when we're older/It'll still be like this
Nanana, you might be right/But nothing's going to change my mind
No, nothing's gonna change my mind, uh-huh
Meredith is bathing Abby in the sink/And he keeps on saying my name
Chris said that God gives you another brick/For the wall each time your heart breaks
Did you know Aspen Grove is 40 thousand trees/With thе same foundation?
Some peoplе see a cobweb hanging in the window/But you see a constellation
Nanana, they might be right/But nothing's gonna change your mind/And nothing's gonna change my mind, uh-huh
(Hit it, boys)
Nanana, they might be right/But nothing's gonna change my mind/And nothing's gonna change your mind
Who's that shadow kicking sunset?
Running up with Muriel to catch the last song/Carolina in the springtime
Caleb at the fire pit scaling the beyond
All I'm running with, babe, is a blank slate towards the ocean
Fuck your rearview/There's no room to shoulder hindsight where we're going
Huh, delight/To live another night
Huh, delight
Delight
Amelia, she's giving me that half smile/She knows something about me I do not know/And behind her, you can see the sun/Reaching its long fingers into a chokehold
She's shuffling bеtween the strobes/Sucking up and rolling the globе
I'm like "How'd you get your leg so high up?" Fuck
Delight, to live another night/Huh, delight
Delight
Walking into the middle of the party
I'm writing a poem, somebody stop me
Simmer, wet as the LA river
Me and all my friends are up late bonding
I can feel the earth it's shaking underneath my shoes
Oh my god there's nothing quite like doing/What you came to do/Percolating, breathing, dancing, dying
Huh, delight/To live another night
Huh, delight/Delight
Delight
Percolating, breathing, dancing, dying
Huh, delight/To live another night
Huh, delight
Delight
Delight
Firefly night, platform shoes
Red light, you were right
Only big as my tequila cup/In the water with the bugs
Sit on it and zip it up
You can think of everyone/And still only be staring at them
But you get your dreams for free
You get your dreams for free
You get your dreams for free
Swimming to the other side
Someday I'm gonna/When I finally forgive myself
I'll be tired and sunburnt/Tripping over Spanish moss again
Today is all of it
There are six minutes of brain activity/After the body's dead
'Cause you get your dreams for free
You get your dreams for free
You gеt your dreams for free
Ferris wheel, sun in the sky
I bеlieve you and I know why
CPR, an iron lung/Feedback loop, biting my tongue
Mother nature wipe us out
Grand prize, we tried
Put a stick on it and/Build a coliseum/Watch them bleed into the night
Are you scared to die?/The trick is don't arrive
You can see it in your daughter's eyes/That's the purpose and the price/And she gets her dreams for free
She gets her dreams for free
She gets her dreams for free
